# Blood-Donation-and-Organ-Donation-Management-System-Using-Java

- This project is a console-based application developed in Java to manage blood and organ donations.
- It allows users to sign up, log in, and choose to either donate or receive resources such as blood, kidneys, lungs, livers, and eyes.
- The system validates user input and eligibility for donations based on age, weight, and donation history. Users can donate specific types of resources based on availability, and recipients can request resources based on their needs.
- It incorporates object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction for managing different types of resources.
